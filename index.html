    <h4>Why should you submit to the will of the family?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Surrounded by family that cares about you.</li>
            <li>Great 401(k) offerings!</li>
            <li>Self-Empowerment through virgin sacrifice.</li>
            <li>Serve our Dark Masters.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>The family was founded by Itami on August 27th, 2019. He raised the family beyond their mortal desires to join them</p>
    <p>as one in a great unified purpose. The family began by eliminating any threats to their dark magics before exiting their</p>
    <p>realm to venture outward amongst the lands to spread their influence and message of love, peace, and tolerance through <strong>ANY</strong> means necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>It is important to remember that we are <em>NOT</em> a cult. You have no reason to distrust us.</strong></p>
